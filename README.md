# Translations and Open Science

In 2020, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR) launched the Translations and Open Science
project (https://operas-eu.org/projects/translations-and-open-science) in order to explore the opportunities offered by
translation technologies to foster multilingualism in scholarly communication and thus help to remove language barriers
according to Open Science principles. MESR commissioned the OPERAS Research Infrastructure to coordinate a series of
preparatory studies in view of establishing a scientific translation service targeted towards a broad audience and
combining relevant technologies, resources and human skills. These studies consist of defining the use cases of a
translation service, collecting resources for training machine translation (MT) systems, fine-tuning MT systems using
these resources, evaluating the MT output, and setting up a roadmap for running a translation service. The fine-tuning
and evaluation activities were performed by CrossLang and its partners LT3 and University of Rennes:

- Fine-tune commercial and open-source MT engines for various scientific disciplines
- Perform automatic evaluation of MT output using reference translations
- Organise human evaluation by various profiles

This repository contains software developed as a result of the above activities:

- Modules for analysing and preparing data
- Modules for calculating automatic evaluation scores based on machine translation output and ground truth (existing
  translations)
- Modules for calculating statistics based on human evaluation of machine translation output
